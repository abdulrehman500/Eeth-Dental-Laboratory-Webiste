This reduces the risk of microfractures which could compromise the restoration.<\/li><li>The football shaped bur is ideal for adjusting occlusion and recontouring anatomy.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use the tapered bur for adjusting interproximal contacts.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to polish zirconia after adjustment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After any adjustment takes place, the adjusted area must be polished. Unpolished zirconia is highly abrasive and will rapidly wear opposing natural dentition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Starting with the brick-red polishers, use light to medium pressure with no water as a pre-polish to remove any coarse bur marks left after adjustments.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finally, use the green polishers to achieve a high lustre mirror finish.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Differences between zirconia types<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are adjusting BruxZir or Monolith, note that these materials usually feature surface staining so please be aware of this when adjusting aesthetic areas. UniZirc does not use surface staining as the shading\/translucency is inherent within the crown and will be present throughout the material.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get in touch with our team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a query we didn\u2019t cover, email us on <a href=\"mailto:info@costech.co.uk\">info@costech.co.uk<\/a> or call on 01474 320 076.
