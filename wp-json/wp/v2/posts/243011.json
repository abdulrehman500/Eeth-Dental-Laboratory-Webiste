It\u2019s a good question and we wanted to share how effective our Brexit plan was with those who didn\u2019t get to meet us at the show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Initial concerns<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Brexit was confirmed, the main things we considered were the effects on staffing levels and our supply chain. Like most British businesses we\u2019d acquired several staff from Europe and were taking advantage of cheap, fast transit on incoming materials. As it turned out, the plans we were putting in place for Brexit would be instrumental in seeing us through the coming Covid pandemic too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-changes-to-our-supply-chain\">Changes to our supply chain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke with our main suppliers regarding arrangements for denture teeth, ceramics, milling blocks, etc\u2026 Early turbulence aside, the supply chain quickly stabilised and barring some slightly longer lead times and increased prices, there has been little change in how we operate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changes to staff<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that the UK has been low on qualified technicians for many years and at peak, 50% of CosTech\u2019s workforce were foreign nationals who had completed all or part of their training abroad. Following Brexit &amp; the Covid-19 pandemic, understandably many of these people decided to go back to their home countries and now just 7% of our technicians are from outside the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"600\" height=\"599\" src=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-recruiting-brexit-blog-post-image-600x600-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-243013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-recruiting-brexit-blog-post-image-600x600-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-recruiting-brexit-blog-post-image-600x600-1-480x479.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making up for lost technicians<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbers of UK technicians are in sharp decline and despite actively recruiting for the last six months we have still not made up the shortfall in lost foreign technicians. Luckily, we began heavy, sustained investment in our digital team in 2012 and Brexit provided the impetus for us to replace more of the manual labour with a digital workflow. This allowed us to increase capacity and improve consistency despite having a smaller team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Preparing for the future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our inception we\u2019ve always taken on trainees at the laboratory and continue to put promising lab assistants through the available apprenticeship schemes. Having said that, intraoral scanners are now commonplace, and more dentists are sending scanned impressions than ever before. The future is in Digital Dentistry and we\u2019re ready to take it on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>*Sneak Preview* Digital Dentures<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you saw us at the exhibition, you would have had a sneak peek at our <strong>3D printed dentures<\/strong>. These are currently only available upon special request as we\u2019re still integrating them into our workflow. Watch this space for more information as they\u2019re coming soon, and we expect them to make the NHS denture process faster and easier for dentists and patients alike!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"771\" src=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-denture-brexit-blog-post-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-243014\" srcset=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-denture-brexit-blog-post-image.jpg 800w, https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/costech-denture-brexit-blog-post-image-480x463.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dentists ask what impact Brexit had on the laboratory.
