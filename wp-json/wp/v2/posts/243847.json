The ease of use for professionals is paired with an incredibly comfortable patient experience making this a real gamechanger for crown &amp; bridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>G-CAM is a unique PMMA-based material that\u2019s nano-reinforced with graphene to make it suitable for permanent restorations. It\u2019s manufactured by the dental division of Graphenano, a Spanish company specialising in graphene application across various industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally launched in 2019, the precise \u201cgraphene doping\u201d process has resulted in a material which ticks almost all the boxes we look for in dentistry:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>High flexural strength<\/li><li>Non-abrasive to opposing dentition<\/li><li>Stable, consistent aesthetics<\/li><li>Easy to adjust without specialist tools<\/li><li>Able to be added to and directly repaired<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does G-CAM look like?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a monolithic material G-CAM is milled from pucks with final appearance like a more natural-looking BruxZir. Pucks are available in shades BL2, A1, A2, A3, A3.5, B2, C2 and Pink as standard. We can also surface stain the material where needed. This makes G-CAM perfect for use in permanent posterior restorations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-strong-is-g-cam\">How strong is G-CAM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While zirconia has a higher hardness rating, G-CAM has a high flexural strength which allows it to absorb impacts more easily. This means G-CAM is excellent at resisting deformation through chewing\/grinding without breaking. In the unlikely event the restoration does break, it can be easily repaired with light-cure composite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When can you prescribe G-CAM?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional PMMA, G-CAM is indicated for almost all permanent restorations, the fact it can be added to with pink composite makes it a particularly good choice for implant solutions. It can be milled very thin and any adjustments can be made easily without the need for specialist tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-comparison-chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-243850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-comparison-chart.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-comparison-chart-980x735.jpg 980w, https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-comparison-chart-480x360.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><figcaption>G-Cam comparison chart<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to prep G-CAM<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"339\" src=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-prep-guide.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-243851\" srcset=\"https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-prep-guide.jpg 800w, https:\/\/costech.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/g-cam-dental-prep-guide-480x203.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 800px, 100vw\" \/><figcaption>G-Cam preparation guide<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s the patient experience like?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of G-CAM\u2019s biggest draws is the experience for the patient. The click-clack sounds that patients hear with porcelain or zirconia restorations are completely absent and the G-CAM equivalent to a 70g zirconia restoration could weigh as little as 12g. This lightness means patients will feel very little difference between the restoration and their natural dentition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Considerations &amp; contraindication<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For cases with a dark\/discoloured prep, we would strongly recommend the use of block-out cement to avoid distortion of the final shade. Due to the method of milling used in G-CAM\u2019s manufacture, we would not recommend the material for inlays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much does G-CAM cost?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>G-CAM is priced fairly for such an exceptional material and the simplicity of manufacture in the lab means we can bring it to you for <strong>just \u00a365\/unit<\/strong>. As there\u2019s no sintering process, we can also drastically reduce turnaround times for urgent cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on this product or our other services, email us on <a href=\"mailto:info@costech.co.uk\">info@costech.co.uk<\/a> or call on 01474 320 076.
